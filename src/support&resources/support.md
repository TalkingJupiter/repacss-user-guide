### Support Process

1. Check Documentation
Before seeking help, start by reviewing the official documentation. Most common setup instructions, troubleshooting steps, and feature explanations are covered in the user guides or knowledge base. This can save time and help you better understand the system.

2. Search the FAQ
If the documentation doesn't answer your question, consult the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. The FAQ typically addresses recurring issues, clarifies confusing points, and offers quick solutions to common problems encountered by other users.

3. Contact the Support Team
If your issue remains unresolved, reach out to the support team. Be sure to include relevant details like your account information, a clear description of the problem, and any steps you've already taken to troubleshoot.

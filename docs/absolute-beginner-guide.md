# Welcome Home: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Using REPACSS

Welcome to REPACSS! Whether you‚Äôre an undergraduate student, a new graduate researcher, or just someone eager to get started with high-performance computing, this guide is for you. Our goal is to walk you through the basics of using the REPACSS cluster ‚Äî from logging in to running your first job.

To make things easier to understand, we‚Äôll use the analogy of a house. REPACSS is like a shared home. You enter through the front door (logging in), have your own room for small items (your home directory), a few common areas like closets and garages for larger items (project and scratch storage), and a kitchen (compute nodes) where the real work happens.

---

## üîë Unlocking the Front Door: Logging In

Before you can start working on REPACSS, you need to log in to the system using SSH.

### SSH Login (The Front Door)

To log in from your local terminal:

```bash
ssh <your_username>@repacss.hpcc.ttu.edu
```

If this is your first time connecting, you'll likely be prompted to verify the server's RSA key fingerprint. Type `yes` to continue. You‚Äôll then enter your password and any additional multi-factor authentication code if your account has MFA enabled.

!!! note 
    Login nodes are for setup and light work only ‚Äî like standing in your foyer. Heavy lifting (computation) should always be done on the compute nodes.

## üóÑ This House Has Closets: Navigating Storage

REPACSS provides different types of storage spaces based on what you‚Äôre doing.

| Storage Type  | Location              | Purpose                                |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Home          | `/home/$USER`         | Permanent space for small files/scripts |
| Scratch       | `/scratch/$USER`      | Fast temporary storage during jobs     |
| Project/Group | `/project/<group>`    | Shared space for team/project data     |

Your home directory is like your room. Keep only essentials here ‚Äî it‚Äôs backed up and secure. Scratch is like the garage: great for big, messy projects in progress, but regularly cleaned out. Project storage is your shared closet with teammates.

!!! warning
    Files in `/scratch` may be automatically deleted if left inactive for too long. Always back up important work!

## üç≥ Cooking with Fire: Running Jobs

Now that you‚Äôre inside the house, it‚Äôs time to use the kitchen ‚Äî the compute nodes.

You can‚Äôt just start computing from the login node. Instead, you must write and submit a **job script** to run your program on compute nodes.

### Example: A Simple Job Script

Create a file called `hello.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=hello
#SBATCH --output=hello.out
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --partition=standard

echo "Hello from REPACSS!"
```

Submit it with:

```bash
sbatch hello.sh
```

Check its status with:

```bash
squeue -u $USER
```

!!! tip
    The `--partition` flag selects which group of compute nodes to use. Common options include `standard`, `gpu`, and `debug`.

---

## üì¶ Recipe Book: Software and Modules

REPACSS uses a **module system** to manage software packages. Instead of installing everything yourself, just load what you need!

### Common Module Commands

```bash
module avail            # See available software
module load gcc         # Load a module
module list             # View currently loaded modules
module unload gcc       # Unload a module
```

If your job needs specific software, include the `module load` commands at the top of your job script.

!!! example
    To use Python in a job, your script might start with:

    ```bash
    module load python
    ```

## üß† Helpful Hints and Where to Get Help

Everyone starts somewhere ‚Äî and nobody knows everything. If you run into trouble:

- Check this user guide
- Ask your PI, research group, or lab manager
- Visit [Support](support.md) to contact the REPACSS team

!!! tip
    When asking for help, include error messages and describe what you were trying to do. The more detail, the better!

## üßπ House Rules: Good HPC Citizenship

Because REPACSS is a shared resource, there are a few best practices to follow:

- **Don‚Äôt compute on the login node.**
- **Use scratch for temporary work**, but clean it regularly.
- **Keep jobs short in the `debug` partition**; use `standard` for production runs.
- **Be respectful of shared storage**; avoid hoarding large files.

## üèÅ Make Yourself at Home

Congratulations! You now understand the basics of REPACSS:

- You‚Äôve logged in
- Learned the storage layout
- Loaded software
- Written and submitted a job

This is just the beginning ‚Äî explore more detailed topics in the rest of the documentation as you grow comfortable.

Happy computing ‚Äî and welcome to the cluster!

## üîë Access & Authentication

- **eRaider**: Texas Tech University's single sign-on account system used for authentication.
- **GlobalProtect**: VPN client required to securely access REPACSS from off-campus or over external networks.
- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**: An extra layer of security requiring two forms of verification to log in.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Components

- **Login Node**: Entry point to the cluster used for compiling code, managing files, and submitting jobs (not for computation).
- **Compute Node**: A server dedicated to running user-submitted compute jobs.
- **GPU Node**: A compute node equipped with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for accelerated workloads.
- **Storage Node**: A server that handles data storage across multiple tiers (home, work, scratch, archive).

---

## üìÅ File Systems

- **$HOME**: Personal storage space for scripts, configs, and small files.
- **$WORK**: Project-based storage shared within research groups.
- **$SCRATCH**: High-speed, temporary storage for active jobs (data here may be purged periodically).

---

## üì¶ Job & Scheduler Terms

- **SLURM**: A job scheduling system used to manage and queue compute jobs on the cluster.
- **sbatch**: SLURM command used to submit a batch job script.
- **squeue**: SLURM command to check job queue status.
- **scancel**: SLURM command to cancel jobs.
- **sinfo**: SLURM command to view the current status of nodes and partitions.

---

## üìÇ File Transfer

- **Globus Connect**: A web-based data transfer tool designed for reliable, high-speed transfers.
- **SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)**: A command-line method to transfer files securely over SSH.
- **Endpoint**: A source or destination location used in Globus transfers.

---

## üß™ Software & Environments

- **Module**: A system that dynamically configures your environment to access specific software versions.
- **Miniforge**: A minimal Conda installer optimized for scientific computing with the conda-forge channel.
- **Conda Environment**: An isolated workspace that contains its own Python interpreter and installed packages.
- **YAML**: A configuration file format commonly used to define environments.

---

## üìä Resource Requests

- **CPU**: Central Processing Unit, used for general-purpose computation.
- **GPU**: Graphics Processing Unit, used for parallel workloads like AI and simulations.
- **Core**: A processing unit within a CPU; multiple cores allow parallel execution.
- **Memory (RAM)**: Temporary working memory used during computations.
- **Partition**: A named subset of cluster resources (e.g., `zen4`, `h100`).

---

## üõ† Debugging & Logs

- **stdout / stderr**: Output and error logs generated by job scripts.
- **job.out / job.err**: Typical filenames for job output/error files.
- **dependency**: A SLURM setting to run a job only after another finishes successfully.

---

## üìö Documentation & Support

- **User Guide**: This documentation repository (you're reading it!).
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions and quick solutions to common problems.
- **Support Ticket**: Formal request for help submitted to the REPACSS team.

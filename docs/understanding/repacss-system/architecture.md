- 110 CPU nodes
- Dual AMD EPYC 9754 processors
- 256 total cores per node
- 1.5‚ÄØTB DDR5 memory
- 1.92‚ÄØTB local NVMe SSD

### GPU Compute Nodes

GPU resources are designed for machine learning, data analytics, and other massively parallel applications.

- 8 GPU nodes
- Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6448Y CPUs (64 cores)
- 512‚ÄØGB RAM per node
- 4 √ó NVIDIA H100 NVL GPUs (94‚ÄØGB HBM each)
- 1.92‚ÄØTB local SSD

### Login Nodes

Users interact with the system through login nodes, where editing, compiling, and job submissions take place.

- 3 login nodes
- Dual AMD EPYC 9254 CPUs (48 cores)
- 256‚ÄØGB RAM
- 1.92‚ÄØTB NVMe SSD

## üíæ Storage Resources

REPACSS has nearly **3‚ÄØPB** of storage capacity distributed across multiple tiers optimized for different use cases.

### Tiered Storage Overview

- **Home**: Persistent personal storage for source code and config files.
- **Scratch**: High-performance temporary storage for active simulations. Subject to purge policy.
- **Archive**: Long-term storage for research results and finalized datasets.

## üóÉ Storage Best Practices

- Use `$HOME` for configs, scripts, and small files
- Use `$SCRATCH` for intermediate output and I/O-heavy workloads
- Archive finalized results in the long-term storage pool

!!! tip "Need more performance?"
    Running I/O intensive jobs? Always use `$SCRATCH` to avoid hitting I/O bottlenecks.

!!! warning "Don't forget to archive!"
    Scratch space is periodically purged. Move important data to long-term storage to avoid data loss.

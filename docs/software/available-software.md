# Available Software on REPACSS

This document provides a formal summary of software environments currently available on the REPACSS high-performance computing system. Software is managed and accessed using the **environment module framework**, which allows users to dynamically configure their shell environments to access compilers, libraries, and applications relevant to their research or instructional activities.

## Guidance for Module Usage

Users are advised to utilize the following commands for listing and managing software modules:

### Display All Available Modules

```bash
module avail
```

### Display Only Default Modules

In the case of an extensive list, users may restrict output to default modules:

```bash
module --default avail
# or
ml -d av
```

### View Module Categories and Quantities

To obtain a summary overview of available module categories and counts:

```bash
module overview
# or
ml ov
```

### Discover All Installed Modules and Extensions

To enumerate all possible software packages and extensions, regardless of default visibility:

```bash
module spider
```

## Loading Software Modules

To access a software environment, load the corresponding module. For example:

```bash
module load gcc/14.2.0
```

To verify currently loaded modules:

```bash
module list
```

To unload a module:

```bash
module unload <module_name>
```

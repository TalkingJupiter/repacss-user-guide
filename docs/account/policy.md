# Account Policies 📜🔐

!!! info "About this Page"
    This page outlines the core account usage policies that apply to all REPACSS users at Texas Tech University. Following these rules ensures safe, secure, and responsible use of HPC resources.

---

## 👤 User Account Ownership, Password, and MFA Policies

Every user is assigned a unique **username**, which is protected by a personal **password** and **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** token. These credentials are private and must **not be shared** under any circumstance.

- 🔑 **Passwords** must be strong and changed periodically. See the [Passwords](passwords.md) page for more.
- 🔐 **MFA tokens** must be securely stored and are tied to individual accounts.
- ❌ **Account sharing is strictly prohibited.** If multiple users are detected accessing a single account, that account will be suspended.

!!! danger "Sharing is a Violation"
    If someone other than the assigned user accesses a REPACSS account, **all associated accounts will be disabled immediately**. Reinstatement requires a formal justification from the PI.

## 🔐 Security Incidents

If you suspect a **security breach** or account misuse, report it **immediately** to:

- 📧 `repacss-support@ttu.edu`

Include any available logs, screenshots, or timestamps when reporting an incident. Prompt action helps protect everyone.

## 🔄 Account Lifecycle

### 🆕 Account Creation
- Accounts must be requested through an official research project.
- New users are vetted by the REPACSS team before access is granted.
- Setup includes MFA registration and password initialization.

### ✅ Account Continuation
- Accounts remain active only if associated with an active TTU project.
- Users must re-accept updated **Policies** and **Code of Conduct** documents when prompted.

### ❌ Account Deactivation

Accounts can be deactivated under several conditions:

| Reason | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| 🔄 End of project allocation | Login disabled, data access only for 60 days |
| 🧑‍🔧 User-initiated | Immediate deactivation |
| 👨‍🏫 PI removes user | Immediate deactivation |
| 🕐 Project membership expiration | Immediate deactivation |
| 📜 Policy agreement not signed | Account suspended until accepted |
| ⚠️ Security violation | Immediate deactivation |

After deactivation:
- Passwords and MFA tokens are deleted.
- Data **may** remain accessible for a limited period through transfer nodes only.

## 📣 Acknowledge Use of REPACSS Resources

!!! info "Why Acknowledgment Matters 📄✨"
    Proper acknowledgment of REPACSS in your publications helps demonstrate the impact of our research infrastructure, supports funding renewals, and shows the broader academic value of our cluster.

If you publish work that involved the use of REPACSS compute resources, **please include the following acknowledgment**:

> **This research used resources of the REPACSS high-performance computing system at Texas Tech University, supported in part by the National Science Foundation under NSF Award No. 2404438 and Texas Tech's High Performance Computing Center (HPCC).**

Including this sentence in your papers, posters, or talks helps ensure continued investment in high-performance computing resources and encourages further research support.

!!! tip "Not sure if you should include this?"
    If your work ran any code, training, or simulations on REPACSS — even during testing — please include the acknowledgment.

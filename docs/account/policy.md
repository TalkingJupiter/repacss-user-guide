# Account Usage Policies

!!! info "Purpose of This Document"
    This document outlines mandatory account usage policies for all users of the REPACSS system at Texas Tech University. Adherence to these policies ensures the security, integrity, and proper utilization of REPACSS high-performance computing (HPC) resources.

---

## Account Ownership, Password Requirements, and MFA Policy

Each user is issued a unique username secured with both a password. The credentials are strictly confidential and must not be shared.

- Passwords must be strong, rotated regularly, and follow the guidelines outlined on the [Passwords](passwords.md) page.
- MFA credentials are tied to the individual user and must be securely stored.
- Shared account usage is strictly prohibited. REPACSS enforces a one-user-per-account policy without exception.

!!! danger "Account Misuse Policy"
    If unauthorized access or account sharing is detected, all affected accounts will be disabled immediately. Reinstatement requires a written explanation and authorization from the Principal Investigator (PI) or project lead.

## Security Incidents and Reporting

Users who suspect account compromise, unauthorized activity, or any security incident must report it immediately to the system administrators.

- Email: [repacss.support@ttu.edu](mailto:repacss.support@ttu.edu)

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible (e.g., timestamps, logs, screenshots) to expedite investigation and remediation.

## Account Lifecycle Management

REPACSS accounts follow a lifecycle process aligned with institutional research allocations.

### Account Provisioning

- Access is granted upon official request and must be tied to a recognized TTU research project.
- New users undergo a vetting process by the REPACSS administrative team.
- Account setup includes MFA enrollment and initial password configuration.

### Account Maintenance

- Accounts remain active only while associated with an ongoing research allocation.
- Users may be prompted to acknowledge and re-accept updated policy or conduct agreements.

### Account Deactivation

Accounts are subject to deactivation under the following conditions:

| Condition                             | Action Taken                                           |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| End of research project               | Login disabled; data access granted for 60 days        |
| User-initiated request                | Immediate deactivation                                 |
| User removed by project PI            | Immediate deactivation                                 |
| Expiration of project membership      | Immediate deactivation                                 |
| Refusal to accept policy updates      | Access suspended until acknowledgment is received      |

Upon deactivation:
- Login credentials and MFA tokens are invalidated.
- Data may be accessible through designated transfer endpoints for a limited duration, subject to administrative approval.

# Account Management

!!! info "Purpose of This Section"
    This section outlines procedures for managing user accounts on the REPACSS High-Performance Computing (HPC) system, including credential updates and authentication protocols.

In order to access REPACSS resources, users must maintain an active and secure account. Proper account management ensures continued access to computing services, storage allocations, and user support systems.

## Password and Credential Management

Secure authentication is required for all user interactions with the REPACSS system. The following credential management practices are supported:

- Secure password updates through the official TTU identity management system
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support
- SSH key registration for secure and password-less logins

If your password is forgotten or compromised, you must contact Texas Tech Universityâ€™s IT Help Central to initiate a reset and regain account access.

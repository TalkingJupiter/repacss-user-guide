# Texas Tech University (TTU) 🏫🐘

!!! info "About this Section 📘"
    This section outlines the role of Texas Tech University in hosting and supporting the REPACSS platform, including local access details and infrastructure support.

## On-Campus Access 🧑‍🏫📶

REPACSS is physically hosted on TTU’s research infrastructure and can be accessed:

- 📍 **On campus** using wired Ethernet or TTUnet Wi-Fi  
- 🌐 **Off campus** via TTU VPN ([VPN Setup Guide](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/itts/software/vpn.php))  
- 🔒 Securely through SSH or web interfaces where applicable  

!!! warning "VPN Required for All Users"
    **All users must be connected to the TTU network to access REPACSS.**  
    This is typically achieved by using **GlobalProtect VPN** when off-campus.  
    🧭 However, users in the **Computer Science Department building** may experience access issues even when connected to TTUnet (campus Wi-Fi).  
    ✅ In such cases, it is recommended to **use GlobalProtect VPN** as a workaround to ensure proper access.

## Research & Training Support 🧪📚

REPACSS supports a wide range of computational research and student training programs at TTU, including:

- 👩‍🔬 Graduate & Undergraduate Research Projects  
- 🧰 Engineering and Computer Science Labs  
- 🖥️ Parallel programming, simulation, and modeling coursework  
- 🧑‍🏫 Faculty-led workshops and technical bootcamps

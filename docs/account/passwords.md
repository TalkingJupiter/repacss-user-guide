# Passwords 🔐  
## Password and Account Protection  

Users are issued a **username** (login name) and **password** to access REPACSS systems. This combination is strictly for **individual use only** — **do not share** your password with others. Sharing passwords is a direct violation of REPACSS policy and may result in suspended access.

Passwords must be changed **immediately** upon suspected compromise or exposure. If you believe your account is compromised, report it promptly to the REPACSS support team at [repacss-support@ttu.edu](mailto:repacss-support@ttu.edu).

## Password Requirements ✅  

All REPACSS passwords must follow the standards below:

## Login Failures 🚫  

Accounts are temporarily locked after **15 failed login attempts**. This lock is automatically cleared after **15 minutes** — no reset is necessary unless you've forgotten your password.

If you're still unable to log in after that time, reach out to support.

---

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 🔐  

Currently, MFA is **not required for REPACSS**. However, if you are using eRaider or accessing through TTU's VPN and services, MFA will apply at the campus level.

!!! info "Purpose of this Section"

## Password Responsibility and Usage Policy

Each user is issued a unique **username** and **password** to access the REPACSS computing environment. These credentials are **strictly personal** and must **not** be shared under any circumstances. Sharing account credentials is a violation of institutional security policy and may result in immediate suspension of system access.

Users are expected to change their password **immediately** if a compromise is suspected. In such cases, notify the REPACSS support team at [repacss.support@ttu.edu](mailto:repacss.support@ttu.edu) without delay.

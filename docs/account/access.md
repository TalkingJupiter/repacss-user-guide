# ACCESS Accounts 

!!! warning "Feature Under Development ðŸš§"
    Integration with the ACCESS (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support) is **not enabled yet** in REPACSS. We're actively working on bringing this feature online to support broader national CI access. Stay tuned!

## What is ACCESS?

ACCESS is a U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) program that provides researchers with access to advanced computational resources, support services, and training. REPACSS aims to integrate with ACCESS in the future to:

- Expand national access to REPACSS resources  
- Support collaboration across U.S. institutions  

If you're already an ACCESS user and interested in future integration testing or early access, please contact us at
